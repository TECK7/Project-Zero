# Project-Zero
## Coderfactory First Term Ruby CLI Application 

## Project Introduction
This is a Todo application that only works in CLI such as PowerShell in Windows 10. The application is called Active Plan. The 
features of this applciation are developed using Ruby 2.2.4 version and are listed as followed.
- allow user to insert to-do-list task
- allow user to review tasks inserted
- allow user make changes to personal settings
- settings adjustment feature such as selection of Task List Template, Prompt Alert Command, Task Analytics and Authentication 
 
At this stage, this application only allows user to add task and review task functions. All tasks added would be recorded into csv file. The task added could be track by different IDs. In other words, when the user quits the application, the task added in its application would still be in the application records. Additionally, this application also have register, signin, and quit features. 

Some ruby gems are also implemented into the application such as ASCII words and table formatting.

## Project Inspiration
In today's modern living society, people tend to have a busy lifestyle and tend to have many plans in mind for the week, but how 
much did they manage to accomplish without a proper planning. Without proper time allocation for our plans, it is hard to know 
whether we have actually fulfilled all of our plans. People either forget what they have planned or just too busy spending time 
playing with mobile phones/tablets or do online shopping. In the end, people may just ask themselves what they have achieved during 
the week. 

This is the reason why I had opted to develop an application that could solve some of the following pains that people are 
currently facing.
 - People would have difficulty to get a person to remind them what they have planned out to do
 - People would struggle to find out what did they do during the week
 - People would struggle to determine how much time they spent on doing different kinds things
 - People would not be able to clearly keep track of their activities patterns 

## Project Planning Stage
Before starting to develop this application, some planning are done such as generating user stories. These user stories are as 
followed.
 - As a un-organised person, I would like to have all my task in one place
 - As a forgetful person, I would like to have something that could remind me what I would be doing the next day
 - As a curious person, I would like to know what I have actually done during the pass few days
 - As a busy person, I would like to have a calender to fit in my favourite hobbies into any available free time slots
 - As a mindful person, I would like to keep track of my activity trends and patterns at one place

The solution is to implement an application that would become a personal-assistant to help solve all the problems and pains of the users. The target market of this application are such as students, workers (part-time / casual), housewives, retiree, and any individual that thinks this application would help.
